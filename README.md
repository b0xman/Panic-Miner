panic miner ideas

-as you purchase items in your limited time, illustration splash of the shopkeeper throwing an item at the miner, player character is throwing gold chunks at the shopkeepers face.

-tentative, when you upgrade your engine, you upgrade the ui interface.

Background gimmick

instead of a static background, the background is made up of random illustrations, depending on the current world, are all made of a set color palette. when the level is generated, the background is generated of potentially 1 large image and several small images.

vehicle movement and particulars

 
the vehicle is broken up into 3 parts. included are some mechanics of the 3 parts as well as some potential upgrades.
also, each part effects variables that tie into speed, damage, hull strength, and fuel.

each part also has spacebar modifiers which have major benefits at the cost of fuel.

the drill
-mechanics-
-chews through blocks: determines how fast the player moves through blocks. 
-is the front runner of the vehicle, determines damage the vehicle takes when drilling through hazards/monsters
-effects fuel consumption

-upgrades-
-drill damage 
it maybe that the damage the drill does to blocks and to monsters are two different variables. a drill may be super fast at drilling but is pretty low damage to enemies.
-damage reduction
obv takes less damage from monsters and hazards, also could be two different variables

-spacebar modifiers-
-boomerang
fires the drill straight forward at a faster speed than the vehicle (always). while the drill is traveling the player can't turn, but the drill comes back when it hits the sides of the map, or when the player presses the space bar again. drills through monsters risk free.

-grappling hook-
 so long as there is space (lack of blocks) then the grappling hook drill can fire a straight line until it hits a wall or monster. it will then pull the vehicle at a faster speed, consuming fuel. until the line is fully reeled.

-molten drill-
does more damage to blocks, so long as the player is holding the spacebar, it obviously churns up blocks pretty good, but consumes fuel at an alarming rate.

-triple drill-
for a period of time gives the player control over three drills at once creating a 3 wide drill. additional drills damage based on your drill damage.


the engine
-mechanics-
-fuel
component needed to use space bar mod as well as keeps the vehicle moving at normal speed. controls speed of vehicle.
-fuel capacity
-fuel efficiency
the player is digging, not just for gold but for fuel, which can take the form of coal, uranium, impossiblite, electrum.
-engine strength
is effected by how much cargo the player is carrying. has a limit, if the player gets too greedy, the vehicle can actually stop dead.

-upgrades-

-spacebar modifiers-
 -the alchemists engine-
converts fuel into gold


-gearshift
lets the player switch between 2 modes:
fast, but low drill strength
slow, but double drill strength



 

cargo
-mechanics-
carries gold, trails behind the player, weighs the player down. if a cargo container is damaged or destroyed, any gold it was carrying is lost and the trailing cargo containers are disconnected from the player until the player moves over them. 
-upgrades-
-capacity increase
-panic at the disconnect
cargo senses that something is about to hit it, so it disconnects itself
-fetal position!
disconnected cargo is invulnerable to all damage and hazards
-
-spacebar modifiers-
